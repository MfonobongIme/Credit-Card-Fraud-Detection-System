# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Introduction
This system is designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes historical transaction data to train a model that can then be used to predict the likelihood of a new transaction being fraudulent.

## Requirements
- Python 3.0
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Usage
1. Run the `train.py` file to train the model using the provided dataset (`creditcard.csv`).
2. Run the `predict.py` file to predict the likelihood of a new transaction being fraudulent. Input the transaction details as prompted.
3. Run the `test.py` file to evaluate the performance of the model using a test dataset (`test_data.csv`).

## Note
- The provided dataset (`creditcard.csv`) is only for training and testing purposes and should not be used for actual transactions.
- The system is only for educational and research purposes and is not intended for use in a production environment.
